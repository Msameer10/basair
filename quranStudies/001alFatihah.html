  <p class="naskh basmalah mt-3 text-center">بِسۡمِ ٱللّٰهِ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ</p>
  <h2 class="text-center noto">Surah al-Fātiḥah</h2>
  <h2 class="text-center arabic">سُورَةُ ٱلْفَاتِحَةِ</h2>
  <div>
    <p class="p">The hadith literature presents al-Fātiḥah not simply as a chapter to be recited, but as the structural and conceptual core of the Qur’an and of ritual prayer. The Prophet ﷺ described it as the greatest surah, emphasizing its unique status among all Qur’anic chapters. He further established that no prayer is complete without its recitation, making al-Fātiḥah a required component of ṣalāh, not an optional opening.<br><br>
  Al-Fātiḥah is also named Umm al-Qur’ān and Umm al-Kitāb, titles that indicate foundational and summarizing functions: it gathers the central themes of the Qur’an—lordship, worship, guidance, and moral orientation—into a compact form. In a well-known hadith qudsī reported in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, al-Fātiḥah is described as a dialogue between God and the servant, with each verse receiving a divine response. This framing redefines prayer as an interactive act rather than a one-sided recitation.<br><br>
  These descriptions do more than elevate its status—they shape how the surah is meant to be read, recited, and understood. This discussion begins from the prophetic framing of al-Fātiḥah itself, treating it not simply as an opening formula, but as a text that establishes the structure of prayer and the orientation of the believer before any further reading takes place. Finally, al-Fātiḥah is described as a unique gift not given to previous communities, underscoring its distinct role in the prophetic mission of Muhammad ﷺ. Collectively, these hadiths present al-Fātiḥah as a summary, a condition, a dialogue, and a distinctive endowment.</p>
  <p class="p">The Basmalah — <i>Bismi llāhi r-Raḥmāni r-Raḥīm</i> — occupies a curious position in Qur’anic scholarship. Although it appears at the opening of every sūrah except one, scholars have long debated whether it forms part of the revealed text of any sūrah, and if so, which ones. This question becomes particularly pronounced in Sūrat al-Fātiḥah, where some traditions treat the Basmalah as the first verse, while others regard it as a separating formula rather than a verse proper. These textual questions naturally lead into discussions of recitation, especially in the context of prayer, where the status of the Basmalah affects how — or whether — it is recited.</p><br>
  <p class="arabic theme_color text-center ayah">بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ<span class="ayah-num"> (١)</span></p>

  <p class="p">Grammatically, the Basmalah begins with <span class="arabic">بِ</span>, where the bāʾ functions as a ḥarf al-jarr, and the word <span class="arabic">ٱسْمِ</span> is an ism, making the phrase <span class="arabic">بِٱسْمِ</span> a jār–majrūr construction. The word <span class="arabic">ٱسْمِ</span> also functions as a potential muḍāf, which becomes explicit when it is followed by <span class="arabic">ٱللّٰهِ</span>, itself an ism majrūr, resulting in a clear iḍāfah relationship: muḍāf and muḍāf ilayh. At this point, the word <span class="arabic">ٱللّٰهِ</span> can be described through its grammatical properties: it is majrūr by position, singular, masculine—a grammatical default of the Arabic language rather than a statement about divine gender—and a proper noun. The two words that follow, <span class="arabic">ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ</span> and <span class="arabic">ٱلرَّحِيمِ</span>, share these same grammatical properties: they are majrūr, singular, masculine, and definite, functioning as recognized Names of Allah. Because of this complete agreement, <span class="arabic">ٱللّٰهِ</span> serves as the mawṣūf (the noun being described), while <span class="arabic">ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ</span> and <span class="arabic">ٱلرَّحِيمِ</span> function as ṣifāt, describing the mawṣūf without the need for repetition, allowing the phrase to unfold as a compact yet layered grammatical structure. Taken together, the phrase is commonly rendered in English as: <i>“In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Especially Merciful.”</i></p>
