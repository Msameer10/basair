  <h2 class="text-center noto">Surah al-Fātiḥah</h2>
  <p class="p">The hadith literature presents al-Fātiḥah not simply as a chapter to be recited, but as the structural and conceptual core of the Qur’an and of ritual prayer. The Prophet ﷺ described it as the greatest surah, emphasizing its unique status among all Qur’anic chapters. He further established that no prayer is complete without its recitation, making al-Fātiḥah a required component of ṣalāh, not an optional opening.<br><br>
  Al-Fātiḥah is also named Umm al-Qur’ān and Umm al-Kitāb, titles that indicate foundational and summarizing functions: it gathers the central themes of the Qur’an—lordship, worship, guidance, and moral orientation—into a compact form. In a well-known hadith qudsī reported in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, al-Fātiḥah is described as a dialogue between God and the servant, with each verse receiving a divine response. This framing redefines prayer as an interactive act rather than a one-sided recitation.<br><br>
  Other narrations report the Prophet’s approval of al-Fātiḥah as a means of healing (ruqyah), indicating that its efficacy lies not only in ritual recitation but in the meanings it invokes. Finally, al-Fātiḥah is described as a unique gift not given to previous communities, underscoring its distinct role in the prophetic mission of Muhammad ﷺ. Collectively, these hadiths present al-Fātiḥah as a summary, a condition, a dialogue, and a distinctive endowment.<br><br></p>
